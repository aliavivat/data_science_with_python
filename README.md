## Introduction

### Overview of the Case Study
This report addresses a case study involving Revolution Consulting, an IT consulting firm known for its high-quality engagements and expertise in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science. The company has observed a decline in the quality of work produced by its consultants, coinciding with increased project delays and client complaints. This situation is further exacerbated by a noticeable uptick in consultant turnover, with new hires seemingly unable to match the knowledge and skill level of their predecessors.

### Refinement of Business Need into Research Goal
In response to these challenges, this report aims to refine the pressing business need â€” understanding and mitigating consultant turnover into a focused research goal. By leveraging data science techniques, the objective is to dissect employment data and survey responses to unearth underlying factors contributing to the turnover phenomenon.

### Research Goal Statement
The research goal of this project is succinctly defined as follows: to analyse employment and survey data to identify the primary drivers of consultant turnover at Revolution Consulting. Through this analysis, the project aims to offer actionable insights and recommendations that the company can implement to bolster employee retention, thereby improving overall work quality and client trust.
